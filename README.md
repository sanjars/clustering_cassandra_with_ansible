# clustering_cassandra_with_ansible
This repo helps you to cluster and install Cassandra single install and clustering with Ansible playbook on Ubuntu 14/16.

More insight to Repo:

*This project is based on Clustering Cassandra servers with Ansible. We have come across to the situation in our company that involved the constant manual installation of Cassandra, and clustering it was the major part of production servers as well. It was not hard but the process would take some time. Everything was documented but still there was need to automate the installation in order to save time and resources. That is the total idea behind DevOps culture.

The script which I should upload to my Git repo - hopefully I do not forget , LoL, will help you to install single installation of Cassandra on Ubuntu 14/16 (The script might have issues when installing on Ubuntu 16 servers, but you should be able edit some stuff and it should work.), and there is another script (yes, there are 2 of them: first for single install and the second is for clustering.) which should help you to Cluster 3 nodes.

The below diagram is very important to take a look at and I highly suggest to. It is very helpful to see what is happening and how it is running. At the end of the day, it will make your life easier by looking at picture rather than going line by line on whole script; however, I still suggest to spend some time to analyze both scripts. Good luck and always stay committed to DevOps culture!*
